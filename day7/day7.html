        var let const differences

        variable redclaration
        var a=10
        var a=20

        variable assignment
        var a;
        a=10;

        variable reassignment
        a=10
        a=20

        initilizatin
        var a=10

scope- g , l

let 
redeclartion is not allowed
assignment is allowed
scope g,l ,b

const 
redeclartion is not allowed
assignment is not allowed
initialization only allowed
scope g,l,b

var , let and const can be hoisted 
but in var it was initialized with undefined
but with let and const it was not  and it was there in
 tdz(tempororal dead zone)
