    collabaration with java sun micro systems -javascript

    uses of the javascript
    frontend (javascript or reaact)
    backend (node js)
    app development (react native)
    game development
    desktop application
    IOT

    javascript
    javascript is a high level programming language that
    is used to create interactive and dynamice nature to the webpages
    
    add to cart
    api calls
    filter 
    search
    validation

    javascript was introduced in 1995 by brendan eich
    10 days
    ecma
    1997 - es1
    1998 - es2
    1999 - es3
    2009 - es 5
    2015 - es 6 *changes- pre requistic for react
           es 15 

    
    features of the js
    single threaded - it can execute one line at a time 
    dynamically typed- no need to specify data type - it will defined
                     in run time
    cross platform - it support all os and browsers
    synchronou and asynchronous
    highlevel - we write code in human readable
    intrepreted - compiled - jit (just in time compilation)

    html -css-browser
    javascript - engine --- browser
    chrome- v8 engine
    edge - chakra
    firefox - spidermonkey

    how javascript works
    code 
    parser - it continously check the syntax
    ast - splitting the code into tokens
    interpreted - compiler - highlevel to lowel level
    execute -- output


   line1 
   line2 - 4mins
   line1000

   event loop mechanism - js run time environment


   callstack - it will execute the programs
   web api- it will provide some features like timers, api calls
             localstorage, location , information
    callback que - where the asychronous operation are handler
    event loop - continously monitor the callstack and callback que

    synchronous - which executes line by line
    asynchrous - parallel execution of a program which having time
               to run






    
write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 

Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different
 types of variables (var, let, and const) and
  prints their values to the console.

Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, 
undefined, null, object, array, and function

Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable
 to the console




 day 3 tasks
 
Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables using 
different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.


Expand the script to include a ternary operation 
that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.

Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
set it to a value between 0 and 100.
 Use nested ternary operators to classify the score into grades:
  A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45), and F (below 45).
   Log the grade.

 Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
 use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30),
  "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10). 
  Log the result.

 Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
 use the ternary operator to classify the age into "Child"
  (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
  and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result
              
  




  Task 1: Day of the Week Message
Scenario: Develop a webpage that displays a special message 
based on the current day of the week.

“Start your week strong!” for Monday.
“Keep going!” for Tuesday.
“Halfway there!” for Wednesday.
“Almost the weekend!” for Thursday.
“Happy Friday!” for Friday.
“Enjoy your weekend!” for Saturday and Sunday.

Task:
Get the current day of the week.
Display the corresponding message.



Task 2: Traffic Light Simulation
Scenario: Simulate a traffic light system.

“Stop” if the light is red.
“Get Ready” if the light is yellow.
“Go” if the light is green.
Task:

Prompt the user to enter the color of the traffic light.
Display the corresponding action.



Task 3: Discount Calculator
Scenario: Calculate the discount based on the total purchase amount.

“No discount” if the amount is less than $50.
“5% discount” if the amount is between $50 and $100.
“10% discount” if the amount is between $101 and $200.
“15% discount” if the amount is above $200.
Task:

Prompt the user to enter the total purchase amount.
Display the discount percentage.


Task 4: Restaurant Menu
Scenario: You are developing a restaurant menu system that provides
 the price of a dish based on the dish name.

Task:
Assume a variable dish holds the name of the dish as a string (e.g.,  "Biriyani", "shawarma", "Fried rice", "veg pula").
Print the price.

Task 5: Simple Calculator
Scenario: You are developing a simple calculator that performs
 basic arithmetic operations.

Task:

Assume variables num1 and num2 hold two numbers, and operator 
holds the arithmetic operator as a string (e.g., “+”).
Use a switch case statement to perform the operation
 and store the result in a variable result.
Print the result.
